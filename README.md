Encoder Design for Huffman Coding Technique - Microproject in VLSI Testing and Verification


Designed an Encoder in Python to encode the data bits using the Huffman Coding Technique. This microproject was carried out in VLSI Testing and Verification under the mentorship and guidance of Mrs. Harpreet Vohra, Assistant Professor, ECED Department at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala.

The program takes two types of inputs: String as well as file inputs. 
It yields the compressed form of the input data and presents it as a text file. 
Also, the Total number of bits in the input and the reduced number of bits after compression are displayed in the terminal window after execution.
